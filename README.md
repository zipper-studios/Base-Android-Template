# Base-Android-Template
This project is a structured template for an Android app that can be used as a starting point for creating your own apps


## Introduction
If you want to start an Android project with a clean architecture, reactive programming integration with Coroutines, Room database usage, Retrofit integration, Locale changer and other basic concepts in any Android application, this code is what you need.

To prove the mentioned concepts, the full-screen <b>Base-Android-Template</b> application contains a BotttomNavigationView with two sections:
- <b>Github Users</b> - is an interactive screen animated using the MotionLayout component. This screen displays a list of Github users fetched from the local Room database. If database does not contain users, the list will be retrieved from the server and then saved in Room. 
- <b>Settings</b> - is the screen where you can switch from Romanian and English languages. Here you can understand how simple and intuitive the Android Locale configurations can be changed.
